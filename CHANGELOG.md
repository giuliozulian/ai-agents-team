# Changelog

All notable changes to this package are documented here. Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `coordinator` now documents an explicit 4-phase workflow (Analyze → Delegate → Validate → Integrate)
  with mandatory human approval checkpoints after the plan and after the diff/code-review result;
  `code-review` is now a required step before any change is considered done, not just an optional gate.
- README documents the human/manual workflow: how a team drives work through `coordinator`, what to
  approve at each phase, and why generated code must go through the `code-review` quality gate before
  being trusted.
- `testing` now auto-installs the live-fetched `writing-tests` skill from `ntcoding/claude-skillz`.
- `security` now auto-installs the live-fetched `security` skill from `openhands/skills`.
- `devops` now auto-installs the live-fetched `ci-cd` skill from `ahmedasmar/devops-claude-skills`.
- `database` now auto-installs the live-fetched `postgres` skill from `planetscale/database-skills`.
- `copy` now auto-installs the live-fetched `copywriting` skill from `coreyhaines31/marketingskills`.
- `performance` now auto-installs the live-fetched `web-performance-optimization` skill from `sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills`.
- New `seo` agent for SEO/GEO/AEO audits and optimization workflows.
- `geo` and `seo` now auto-install the live-fetched `seo-geo-aeo` skill from `SNLabat/SEO-GEO-AEO-Skill`.
- `pm` now auto-installs the live-fetched `docs-maintenance` skill from `jeffrigby/somepulp-agents`.
- `code-review` now auto-installs the live-fetched `code-review` skill from `petyosi/rc`.
- `release` now auto-installs the live-fetched `release-skills` skill from `JimLiu/baoyu-skills`.

### Changed
- Unified `design` and `designer` into a single `design` agent; removed the standalone `designer` template.
- `design` now uses the live-fetched `design-taste-frontend` skill and includes implementation-ready frontend handoff responsibilities.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-06

### Added
- New `designer` agent focused on interface direction and frontend handoff collaboration.
- Live-fetched `design-taste-frontend` skill (from `Leonxlnx/taste-skill`) auto-installed when `designer` is selected.
- README updates for the new `designer` role and skill mapping (team now includes 16 agents).
- `init` now auto-updates consumer `.gitignore` with toolkit-managed outputs (`.github/agents/`, `.github/skills/`, `.github/instructions/`, `.github/ai-agents-team.lock.json`).

### Changed
- `sync` now detects templates newly introduced by the toolkit but not yet installed in the project, and prints an explicit message to run `init` for installing them.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-06

### Changed
- `init` interactive prompt now lists only `agents/*` and `instructions/*` (skills are no longer a manual selection).
- Skill files are auto-installed based on selected agent dependencies (e.g. `frontend` -> `frontend-design`, `accessibility` -> accessibility skills, `coordinator` -> `grilling`).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added
- CLI (`ai-agents-team`) with `init`, `sync`, and `list` commands.
- Manifest-based (`.github/ai-agents-team.lock.json`) hash tracking to detect locally-modified files and avoid silent overwrites during `sync`.
- First set of generic sub-agents: `coordinator`, `security-reviewer`, `frontend-engineer`, `accessibility-auditor`, `performance-auditor`, `qa-test-engineer`.
