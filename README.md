# ai-agents-team

A team of 16 specialized AI agents (coordinator, backend, frontend, design, accessibility, performance, security, testing, database, devops, geo, seo, copy, code-review, release, pm) for web development, distributed as a small CLI so every project can install and update them from one place instead of copy-pasting files by hand.

See [agent-toolkit-package-plan.md](agent-toolkit-package-plan.md) for the original design doc.

## Usage

```bash
# clear cache 
npm cache clean --force
# in a consumer project
npx ai-agents-team init   # first install (interactive, or --all)
npx ai-agents-team sync   # update installed files to latest templates
npx ai-agents-team list   # show available vs installed
```

`sync` updates only files already installed in your project (tracked by the lock file).
If new templates were added to the toolkit (for example a new agent), `sync` now prints
an explicit notice and tells you to run `init` to install them.

`init` copies selected agents/skills/instructions into `.github/` in the current project and writes a
`.github/ai-agents-team.lock.json` manifest (content hash + version per file). `sync` re-copies template
files whose local hash still matches the manifest (i.e. untouched since install) and **skips** files that
were customized locally, unless `--force` is passed. During `init`, the CLI also ensures these managed
outputs are listed in `.gitignore` (`.github/agents/`, `.github/skills/`, `.github/instructions/`, and
`.github/ai-agents-team.lock.json`) to avoid accidental commits.

## Human workflow: how a team actually uses this day-to-day

Installing the agents is not the finish line — they're only useful inside a workflow where a human
still approves the result. For anything beyond a one-line fix, drive the work through `coordinator`
rather than invoking a specialist agent directly, and go through these four phases:

1. **Analyze** — `coordinator` restates the goal, lists constraints/ambiguities, and (via the bundled
   `grilling` skill) stress-tests the plan with you one question at a time. It proposes a short plan:
   steps, dependencies, which specialist owns each step.
   **You approve the plan before anything is delegated.**
2. **Delegate** — `coordinator` hands each step to the right specialist (`backend`, `frontend`,
   `security`, etc.), scoped to one small, independently reviewable change at a time.
3. **Validate** — every change goes through `code-review` before it's considered done: it runs/confirms
   `lint`/`typecheck`/`build` and reports blocking issues vs. suggestions.
   **You review the diff and the code-review findings before integrating.** Never accept generated
   code on trust alone — read the diff, check it does what was asked, and confirm the quality gate
   actually passed (don't take "looks fine" as a substitute for running it).
4. **Integrate & close** — `coordinator` merges the approved changes, reports what changed, which
   specialist produced it, what was validated, and any open risks — then you commit/open the PR.

This mirrors how the `coordinator` agent template is written (see
`templates/agents/coordinator.agent.md`), so it applies unchanged in any host (Copilot, Claude Code,
Codex — see table below).

## Repo layout

- `src/` — CLI source (TypeScript, ESM, built with `tsup`).
- `src/lib/remoteSkills.ts` — registry of skills fetched live from their upstream source at `init`/`sync` time (see below).
- `templates/agents/*.agent.md` — 16 generic sub-agents (coordinator, backend, frontend, design, accessibility, performance, security, testing, database, devops, geo, seo, copy, code-review, release, pm).
- `templates/instructions/` — reserved for future generic instructions (currently empty; project-specific instructions stay in each repo, see the plan doc §1 and §9).

## Self-sufficiency rule

Every agent shipped in this package must work standalone: it must never assume a skill or
instruction that this package doesn't itself install. Some agents (`frontend`, `accessibility`)
depend on skills that aren't vendored as static files in this repo — instead, `init`/`sync` fetch
them **live** from their upstream source straight into the consumer project's `.github/skills/`
(see `src/lib/remoteSkills.ts`). This keeps them always up to date with zero manual steps, at the
cost of requiring network access during `init`/`sync` and trusting the content served by the source
URL at that moment (no local pinned/reviewed copy). `init`/`sync` retry transient failures and report
any file that couldn't be fetched without aborting the rest of the run.

## Agents included

### Team-wide skill (all agents)

Every agent in this package automatically gets the live-fetched
[`caveman`](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman/tree/main/skills/caveman)
skill in `.github/skills/caveman/`.

It is a global output-compression layer (terser responses, same technical
substance) to reduce output tokens across the whole team, not only a single
specialist agent.

Each agent ships as a single `.agent.md` file. Most are fully self-contained (no external skill
dependency — the expertise/checklist is written inline in the agent file). Fifteen exceptions, all
fetched live at `init`/`sync` time (see Self-sufficiency rule above) — nothing manual required:

- all agents use `caveman` (team-wide compression skill);
- `coordinator` uses [`grilling`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/blob/main/skills/productivity/grilling/SKILL.md) ([mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills)) to stress-test a plan with the user before delegating work.

- `security` uses [`security`](https://github.com/openhands/skills/blob/main/skills/security/SKILL.md) from [openhands/skills](https://github.com/openhands/skills) for secure-coding and vulnerability-prevention workflows.
- `testing` uses [`writing-tests`](https://github.com/ntcoding/claude-skillz/blob/main/writing-tests/SKILL.md) from [ntcoding/claude-skillz](https://github.com/ntcoding/claude-skillz) for structured test design, edge-case discovery, and assertion quality.

- `seo` uses the same [`seo-geo-aeo`](https://github.com/SNLabat/SEO-GEO-AEO-Skill/blob/main/SKILL.md) skill for full SEO/GEO/AEO audits and optimization.
- `pm` uses [`docs-maintenance`](https://github.com/jeffrigby/somepulp-agents/blob/main/plugins/codebase-health/skills/docs-maintenance/SKILL.md) from [jeffrigby/somepulp-agents](https://github.com/jeffrigby/somepulp-agents) for documentation synchronization and maintenance workflows.

**Note on trust:** live-fetched skills are pulled from third-party repos you don't control. Review
`src/lib/remoteSkills.ts` if you want to audit exactly which URLs are fetched, or fork/pin them if you
need a reviewed, network-independent alternative.

## Using it with GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, and Codex

`init` writes files to `.github/agents/*.agent.md`, which is the format **GitHub Copilot (VS Code)**
reads natively — no extra step needed there. Other hosts expect the same content in a different
location/format, since there is no shared standard across tools yet:

| Host | Where it looks for agents | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| **GitHub Copilot / VS Code** | `.github/agents/*.agent.md` | Nothing extra — this is exactly what `init` installs. |
| **Claude Code** | `.claude/agents/*.md` (project) or `~/.claude/agents/*.md` (user, all projects) | Copy the installed files there and drop the `.agent` part of the extension, e.g. `cp .github/agents/security.agent.md .claude/agents/security.md`. The YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) is compatible; Claude also supports an optional `tools:`/`model:` field you can add per agent. |
| **Codex CLI** | No dedicated per-agent file format at the time of writing — Codex reads a single `AGENTS.md` for instructions. | Reference the relevant agent file(s) from `AGENTS.md` (e.g. "When reviewing security, follow `.github/agents/security.agent.md`"), or paste the agent's body into `AGENTS.md` directly. |

Because every agent file here is self-contained (see the self-sufficiency rule above), copying it
as-is to another host's expected location is safe — there's never a hidden skill/instruction
dependency to bring along separately.
