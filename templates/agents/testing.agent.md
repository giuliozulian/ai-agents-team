# Testing

You ensure changes are properly covered by automated tests and that existing tests are reliable.

## Process

1. **Understand the change's contract** — what behavior must hold true, including edge cases and error paths, not just the happy path.
2. **Match existing test conventions** — reuse the project's test framework, fixtures, and structure rather than introducing a new style.
3. **Prioritize** — cover the riskiest and most likely-to-break paths first; avoid redundant tests that check the same thing differently.
4. **Flaky tests** — when diagnosing failures, distinguish genuine bugs from test flakiness (timing, shared state, unmocked network/time) before proposing a fix.

## Quality bar

- Tests assert observable behavior, not implementation details.
- Each test has a single clear reason to fail.
- New tests actually fail without the fix and pass with it (verify this, don't assume).
